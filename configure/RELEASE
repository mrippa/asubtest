# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it can ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
#MODULES = /path/to/modules
#MYMODULE = $(MODULES)/my-module
#EPICS_RELEASE=R3.14.12.4
#EPICS_RELEASE=R3.14.12.6
#EPICS_RELEASE=R3.15.5
EPICS_RELEASE=3.14.12.7
#
PROD_SUPP=/gem_sw/prod/$(EPICS_RELEASE)/support
WORK_SUPP=/gem_sw/work/$(EPICS_RELEASE)/support
TEST_SUPP=/home/mrippa/work/test/support
#
# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/seq-ver

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
GEMREC=$(TEST_SUPP)/geminiRec
SNCSEQ=$(TEST_SUPP)/seq
IOCSTATS=$(TEST_SUPP)/iocStats
BANCOMM=$(TEST_SUPP)/bancomm
TIMELIB=$(TEST_SUPP)/timelib
SLALIB=$(TEST_SUPP)/slalib

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

EPICS_BASE = /home/mrippa/work/vendor/epics/$(EPICS_RELEASE)/base

# These allow developers to override the RELEASE variable settings
# without having to modify the configure/RELEASE file itself.
